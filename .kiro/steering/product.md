# Product Overview

This is a simple Rust learning project that demonstrates basic struct implementation and methods. The project implements a `Rectangle` struct with geometric operations including area calculation, containment checking, and square creation.

## Purpose

- Educational Rust project focusing on struct definitions and method implementations
- Demonstrates ownership, borrowing, and method syntax in Rust
- Simple geometric calculations and comparisons

## Key Features

- Rectangle struct with width and height properties
- Area calculation method
- Rectangle containment logic (can one rectangle fit inside another)
- Square creation as a special case of rectangle
